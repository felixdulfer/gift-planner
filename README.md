   This will build the app and deploy only the hosting service.

   Or deploy everything (hosting, Firestore rules, etc.):
   ```bash
   bun run deploy:all
   ```

### Configuration

The app is configured with:
- Build output: `dist` directory (configured in `vite.config.ts`)
- Base path: `/` (root path for Firebase Hosting)
- Firebase hosting config: `firebase.json` points to `dist` directory
- SPA routing: All routes rewrite to `/index.html` for client-side routing

### Manual Deployment Steps

1. Build the application:
   ```bash
   bun run build
   ```

2. Deploy to Firebase:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only hosting
   ```

Your app will be available at your Firebase hosting URL (e.g., `https://your-project-id.web.app`).

ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
```

## Firebase Setup

This application uses Firebase for authentication and Firestore for data storage. To set up Firebase:

1. **Create a Firebase Project** (if you haven't already):
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) and create a new project
   - Wait for the project to finish initializing

2. **Enable Authentication**:
   - Go to Authentication → Sign-in method
   - Enable "Email/Password" provider
   - Save the changes

3. **Create Firestore Database**:
   - Go to Firestore Database → Create database
   - Start in test mode (you'll configure security rules later)
   - Choose a location for your database

4. **Get Configuration**:
   - Go to Project Settings → General
   - Scroll to "Your apps" section
   - Click "Add app" → Web (</> icon)
   - Register your app and copy the configuration values
   - Add them to your `.env` file

5. **Configure Firestore Security Rules**:
   - Go to Firestore Database → Rules
   - Set up rules to allow authenticated users to read/write their own data
   - Example basic rules:
   ```javascript
   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       // Users can read/write their own user document
       match /users/{userId} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
       }
       // Add more rules for other collections as needed
     }
   }
   ```

The application uses the following Firestore collections:
- `users` - User profiles
- `groups` - Gift groups
- `groupMembers` - Group membership
- `events` - Events within groups
- `receivers` - Gift receivers
- `wishlists` - Wishlists for receivers
- `gifts` - Individual gifts
- `giftAssignments` - Gift assignments to users

## Routing

This project uses [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router). The initial setup is a file based router. Routes are managed as files in `src/routes`.

### Adding A Route

To add a new route to your application just add another a new file in the `./src/routes` directory.

TanStack will automatically generate the content of the route file for you.

Now that you have two routes you can use a `Link` component to navigate between them.

### Adding Links

To use SPA (Single Page Application) navigation you will need to import the `Link` component from `@tanstack/react-router`.

```tsx
import { Link } from "@tanstack/react-router";
```

Then anywhere in your JSX you can use it like so:

```tsx
<Link to="/about">About</Link>
```

This will create a link that will navigate to the `/about` route.

More information on the `Link` component can be found in the [Link documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/v1/docs/framework/react/api/router/linkComponent).

### Using A Layout

In the File Based Routing setup the layout is located in `src/routes/__root.tsx`. Anything you add to the root route will appear in all the routes. The route content will appear in the JSX where you use the `<Outlet />` component.

Here is an example layout that includes a header:

```tsx
import { Outlet, createRootRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { TanStackRouterDevtools } from "@tanstack/react-router-devtools";

import { Link } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  component: () => (
    <>
      <header>
        <nav>
          <Link to="/">Home</Link>
          <Link to="/about">About</Link>
        </nav>
      </header>
      <Outlet />
      <TanStackRouterDevtools />
    </>
  ),
});
```

The `<TanStackRouterDevtools />` component is not required so you can remove it if you don't want it in your layout.

More information on layouts can be found in the [Layouts documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/routing-concepts#layouts).

## Data Fetching

There are multiple ways to fetch data in your application. You can use TanStack Query to fetch data from a server. But you can also use the `loader` functionality built into TanStack Router to load the data for a route before it's rendered.

For example:

```tsx
const peopleRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: "/people",
  loader: async () => {
    const response = await fetch("https://swapi.dev/api/people");
    return response.json() as Promise<{
      results: {
        name: string;
      }[];
    }>;
  },
  component: () => {
    const data = peopleRoute.useLoaderData();
    return (
      <ul>
        {data.results.map((person) => (
          <li key={person.name}>{person.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    );
  },
});
```

Loaders simplify your data fetching logic dramatically. Check out more information in the [Loader documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/data-loading#loader-parameters).

### React-Query

React-Query is an excellent addition or alternative to route loading and integrating it into your application is a breeze.

First add your dependencies:

```bash
bun add @tanstack/react-query @tanstack/react-query-devtools
```

Next we'll need to create a query client and provider. We recommend putting those in `main.tsx`.

```tsx
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";

// ...

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

// ...

if (!rootElement.innerHTML) {
  const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(rootElement);

  root.render(
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <RouterProvider router={router} />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
}
```

You can also add TanStack Query Devtools to the root route (optional).

```tsx
import { ReactQueryDevtools } from "@tanstack/react-query-devtools";

const rootRoute = createRootRoute({
  component: () => (
    <>
      <Outlet />
      <ReactQueryDevtools buttonPosition="top-right" />
      <TanStackRouterDevtools />
    </>
  ),
});
```

Now you can use `useQuery` to fetch your data.

```tsx
import { useQuery } from "@tanstack/react-query";

import "./App.css";

function App() {
  const { data } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ["people"],
    queryFn: () =>
      fetch("https://swapi.dev/api/people")
        .then((res) => res.json())
        .then((data) => data.results as { name: string }[]),
    initialData: [],
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {data.map((person) => (
          <li key={person.name}>{person.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

You can find out everything you need to know on how to use React-Query in the [React-Query documentation](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview).

## State Management

Another common requirement for React applications is state management. There are many options for state management in React. TanStack Store provides a great starting point for your project.

First you need to add TanStack Store as a dependency:

```bash
bun add @tanstack/store
```

Now let's create a simple counter in the `src/App.tsx` file as a demonstration.

```tsx
import { useStore } from "@tanstack/react-store";
import { Store } from "@tanstack/store";
import "./App.css";

const countStore = new Store(0);

function App() {
  const count = useStore(countStore);
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => countStore.setState((n) => n + 1)}>
        Increment - {count}
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

One of the many nice features of TanStack Store is the ability to derive state from other state. That derived state will update when the base state updates.

Let's check this out by doubling the count using derived state.

```tsx
import { useStore } from "@tanstack/react-store";
import { Store, Derived } from "@tanstack/store";
import "./App.css";

const countStore = new Store(0);

const doubledStore = new Derived({
  fn: () => countStore.state * 2,
  deps: [countStore],
});
doubledStore.mount();

function App() {
  const count = useStore(countStore);
  const doubledCount = useStore(doubledStore);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => countStore.setState((n) => n + 1)}>
        Increment - {count}
      </button>
      <div>Doubled - {doubledCount}</div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

We use the `Derived` class to create a new store that is derived from another store. The `Derived` class has a `mount` method that will start the derived store updating.

Once we've created the derived store we can use it in the `App` component just like we would any other store using the `useStore` hook.

You can find out everything you need to know on how to use TanStack Store in the [TanStack Store documentation](https://tanstack.com/store/latest).
